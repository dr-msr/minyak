# Bug Fixes : 26 March 2024

## News List Update

We have fixed a bug related to the news list. Now, the news list is using ReactQuery for data fetching. This change will ensure that the content is refreshed every 6 hours, keeping the news list up-to-date and relevant.

## Backup Function Update

We have also made an improvement to the backup function. Now, the name of the savefile includes the latest odometer reading. This change will make it easier to identify and manage backup files.
