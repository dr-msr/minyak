We are excited to announce the launch of version 1 of the Minyak.Today app! 

Minyak.Today aims to provide Malaysian drivers with easy access to the latest fuel prices and helpful driving tips. Version 1 includes:

- Real-time fuel price tracking for RON95, RON97, and Diesel
- Fuel price history and trends
- Notifications when fuel prices change
- Driving efficiency tips and fuel saving advice
- User friendly interface optimized for mobile

We built this app to give drivers the information they need to make smart fuel purchasing decisions and improve the efficiency of their vehicles.

Over the coming months, we plan to rapidly iterate and add new features based on user feedback. Let us know what you think by using the Help link below.

Thank you for supporting Minyak.Today! Please help spread the word to fellow Malaysian drivers.
